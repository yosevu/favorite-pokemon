- `npm start`

## Stories

### List first 9 Pokémon

- Render a dynamic list of monsters using getMonsters from the src/data.js module.
- Consider:
  - What monster data is relevant for the UI?
  - How do functional design concepts apply to rendering a dynamic list of monsters?
  - How can the app be refactored to make the design more functional?
- Explore and describe the relevant core functional design concepts in your words.

### Like and unlike Pokémon 

- Like and unlike monsters.
- Consider:
  - How can application state be represented and managed in functional design?
  - How do functional design concepts apply to liking and unliking monsters?
  - How can the app be refactored to make the design more functional?
- Explore and describe the relevant core functional design concepts in your words.
